	<blockquote cite="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple">
		The apple forms a tree that is small and deciduos, reaching 3 to 13 metres
		(9.8 to 39 ft) tall, with a broad, often densely twiggy crown.
		<hr>
		The leaves are alternately arranged simple ovals 5 to 12 cm long and 3-6
		centimeters (1.2-2.4 in) broad on a 2 to 5 centimetres (0.79 to 2.0 in) petiole
		with anacute tip, serrated margin and a slighty downy undeside. Blossoms are
		produced in spring simultaneously with the budding of the leaves.
		<hr>
		The flowers are white with a pink tinge that gradually fades, five petaled,
		and 2.5 to 3.5 centimetres (0.98 to 1.4 in) in diameter.
		The fruit matures in autumn, and is typically 5 to 9 centimetres (
		2.0 to 3.5 in) in diameter.
		<hr>
		The center of the fruit contains five carpels arranged in a five-point star,
		each carpel containing one to three seeds, called pips.

	<p><strong>Warning:</strong> Eating too many oranges can give you heart burn.</p>

	<p>My favorite kind of orange is the mandarin, properly known
			as <i>citrus reticular</i>.
		Oranges at my local store cost <s>$1 each</s> $2 for 3.</p>

	<p>The <abbr title="Florida Departament of Citrus">FDOC</abbr> regulates the florida
			citrus industry.</p>

	<p>I still remember the best apple I ever tasted.
		I bought it at <time datetime="15:00">3 o`clock</time>
			on <time datetime="1984-12-7">December 7th</time>.</p>
