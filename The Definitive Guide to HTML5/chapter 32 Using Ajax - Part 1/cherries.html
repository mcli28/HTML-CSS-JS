		True cherry fruits are borne by members of the subgenus Cerasus, which is
		distinguished by having the flowers in small corymbs of several together
		(not singly, nor in racemes), and by having a smooth fruit with only a weak
		groove or none along one side. The subgenus is native to the temperate
		regions of the Northern Hemisphere, with two species in America,
		three in Europe, and the remainder in Asia. The majority of eating cherries
		are derived from either Prunus avium, the wild cherry (sometimes called the
		sweet cherry), or from Prunus cerasus, the sour cherry.
