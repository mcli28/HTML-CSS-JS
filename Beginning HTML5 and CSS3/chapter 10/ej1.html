<body>
    <p>There were four of us—George, and William Samuel Harris, and myself, and Montmorency.
    We were sitting in my room, smoking, and talking about how bad we were—bad from a medical
    point of view I mean, of course.</p>
    <p>We were all feeling seedy, and we were getting quite nervous about it. Harris said
    he felt such extraordinary fits of giddiness come over him at times, that he hardly knew what
    he was doing; and then George said that he had fits of giddiness too, and hardly knew what he
    was doing. With me, it was my liver that was out of order.</p>
    <p class="aside">I knew it was my liver that was out of order, because I had just been
    reading a patent liver-pill circular, in which were detailed the various symptoms by which a
    man could tell when his liver was out of order. I had them all.</p>
