        Offline web applications are a new feature of HTML5. When
        we visit a website which has this feature, the browser
        downloads all the files that are required for the user to
        access that specific website. Once the download is
        complete, the website can be accessed offline.

        This is particularly useful when there is intermittent
        internet connectivity. Once we are online, the web server
        can be updated in case changes have been made
